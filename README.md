# Stack

 * REACTJS! (first react project ever woohoo!)

# Libraries

 * react-hook-form

* BIG BIG ups to bluebill1049. Using this library made the custom validation for the form SO much easier then I thought it was going to be! I am blessed to have found out about this form library!


# Impressions: 

* Starting off I was SO confused. I npx-create-react-app in my vscode terminal and wham. A GAZILLION .js files sprouted out of nowhere, packagelock.json files this that holy smokes. 

* I was so overwhelmed I had to step away for a day to really understand what was necessary and what wasn't, but after reading documentation and watching some videos I think I have a better idea of what really is going on.


# What I liked about React

* One of the main benefits of React.js (so I've heard) is the functional component elements of it. However, since only I was working on this    project it ended up just making a bunch of different files with corresponding CSS files everywhere so it did become a little messy. Either way, I wanted to learn React.js eventually so I figured this would be a good project to do so!

* [useState] I love useState. That is all I have to say about it.

# Challenges

* By FAR the biggest problem I had this for this challenge was planning. I (foolishly) went in blind, and as a result ended up refactoring multiple things over and over again. My next project I will dedicate a good amount of time to pre-planning how I want everything done.

* Parent and child elements. It took me HOT minute trying to understand 1. Why it was a thing and 2. how it even worked.

* Grasping the concept of JSX was so strange to me. I knew it was just basically HTML but with JS built in, however it took a little while to get comfortable with the new environment.

* Organization was a challenge as well. I'm still not too sure about where certain things should and shouldn't go, for example my media queries in this project were all over the place. I ended up putting a bulk of it inside of App.css.

# Conclusion

* I think I finally realized how important pre-planning is for larger projects like these. Since they aren't just HTML CSS anymore I needed to really think about how everything was supposed to work. Obviously as you read above I didn't but that's just a life lesson for next time to be honest.

* I still have alot to learn but I hope I only get better from here :)
